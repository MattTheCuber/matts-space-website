          <p>
            Hubble's first look found thousands of unseen, faraway galaxies. &nbsp; The long-exposure image taken with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope is the deepest-ever picture taken of a cluster of galaxies, and also contains images of some of the faintest galaxies ever detected. &nbsp; The target is the massive cluster Abell 2744, which contains several hundred galaxies. &nbsp; The immense gravity in this foreground cluster is being used as a "gravitational lens," which warps space to brighten and magnify images of far-more-distant background galaxies. &nbsp; Observations are being done with NASA's two other Great Observatories, the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. &nbsp; The Hubble exposure reveals nearly 3,000 of these background galaxies interleaved with images of hundreds of foreground galaxies in the cluster. &nbsp; The many background galaxies would otherwise be invisible without the boost from gravitational lensing. Their images not only appear brighter, but also smeared, stretched, and duplicated across the field. &nbsp; Thanks to the gravitational lensing phenomenon, the background galaxies are magnified to appear up to 10 to 20 times larger than they would normally appear. &nbsp; Also the faintest of these highly magnified objects have brightnesses roughly 10 to 20 times fainter than any galaxies ever previously observed.
          </p>
            As the Abell cluster was being photographed with Hubble's wide field camera 3, the telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys was trained on a nearby parallel field that is 6 arc minutes away from the cluster. &nbsp; In this field, Hubble resolves roughly 10,000 galaxies seen in visible light, most of which are randomly scattered galaxies.
          <p>
            Hubble will again view these two frontier fields in May 2014, but Hubble's visible-light and infrared camera will switch targets. &nbsp; This will allow for both fields to be observed over a full range of colors, from ultraviolet light to near-infrared.
          </p>
            The Hubble Space Telescope is a collaboration between ESA and NASA. It's a long-term, space-based observatory. The observations are carried out in visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. &nbsp; In many ways Hubble has revolutionised modern astronomy, by not only being an efficient tool for making new discoveries, but also by driving astronomical research in general.

            <h1><u>Facts</u></h1>
            <br>
            Hubble is nearly the size of a large school but it can fit inside a space shuttle cargo bay.
            <br>
            Hubble's two mirrors were ground so that they do not deviate from a perfect curve by more than 1/800,000th of an inch. If Hubble's primary mirror were scaled up to the diameter of the Earth, the biggest bump would be only six inches tall.

            Launch: April 24, 1990 from space shuttle Discovery (STS-31)
            <br>
            Deployment: April 25, 1990
            <br>
            Mission Duration: Up to 20 years
            <br> 
            Length: 43.5 ft (13.2 m)
            <br>
            Weight: 24,500 lb (11,110 kg)
            <br>
            Maximum Diameter: 14 ft (4.2 m)
            <br>
            Orbit: At an altitude of 307 nautical miles (569 km, or 353 miles), inclined 28.5 degrees to the equator (low-Earth orbit)
            <br>
            Time to Complete One Orbit: 97 minutes
            <br>
            Speed: 17,500 mph (28,000 kph)
            <br>
            Hubble transmits about 120 gigabytes of science data every week. That's equal to about 3,600 feet (1,097 meters) of books on a shelf. The rapidly growing collection of pictures and data is stored on magneto-optical disks.
            <br>
            Energy Source: The Sun
            <br>
            Mechanism: Two 25-foot solar panels
            <br>
            Power usage: 2,800 watts
            <br>
            In order to take images of distant, faint objects, Hubble must be extremely steady and accurate. The telescope is able to lock onto a target without deviating more than 7/1000th of an arcsecond, or about the width of a human hair seen at a distance of 1 mile.
