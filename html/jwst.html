        The James Webb Space Telescope is NASA's next orbiting observatory and the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. &nbsp; A tennis court-sized telescope orbiting far beyond Earth's moon, Webb will detect infrared radiation and be capable of seeing in that wavelength as well as Hubble sees in visible light.
        &nbsp; Right now, scientists and engineers are piecing Webb together, creating through cutting-edge technology an innovative observatory that not only withstands intense cold, but uses it to its advantage; an observatory that folds up inside a rocket for launch and unfurls like a butterfly opening its wings upon nearing its orbit. &nbsp; Later, probably 2018, the Webb telescope will launch into space, sailing to the distant, isolated orbit where it will begin its quest.

        The James Web Space Telescope 72 feet long and 39 feet wide that is almost as big as a football field!
