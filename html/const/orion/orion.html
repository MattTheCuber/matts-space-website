      Orion-The Hunter.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <u><b>Orion the Hunter</b></u> is located is the <b>quadrant NQ1</b>.  People in northwestern Mexico call the three stars in the belt of Orion Hapj (a name denoting a hunter) which has three stars: Hap (mule deer), Haamoja (pronghorn), and Mojet (bighorn sheep).  Around Orion is Taurus to the northwest, Eridanus to the southwest, Lepus to the south, Monoceros to the east, and Gemini to the northeast.  Orion covering an area of 594 square degrees.  Orion is twenty-sixth of the 88 constellations in size.  Orion is seen in the evening sky from December to March, winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.  From May-July (summer in the Northern Hemisphere, winter in the Southern Hemisphere), Orion is mostly seen in the daytime sky so that means it is not visible.  But, Antarctica and the Southern Hemisphere's winter months, stars are then visible at sunset for a few hours.  In countries close to the equator (Indonesia, Colombia, Ecuador), Orion appears overhead in December around midnight and in the February evening sky.  Orion is very useful to locate other stars, and constellations.  By extending the line of the Belt southeastward, Sirius can be found; northwestward, Aldebaran.  A line eastward across the two shoulders indicates the direction of Procyon.  A line from Rigel through Betelgeuse points to Castor and Pollux.  Rigel is part of the Winter Circle (a circle in the sky).  Sirius and Procyon, which may be located from Orion by following imaginary lines (see map right), also are points in both the Winter Triangle and the Circle.
