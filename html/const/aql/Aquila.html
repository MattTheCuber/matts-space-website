      The alpha star, Altair, is a vertex of the Summer Triangle. The best time to see the connstellation is in the summer.
      <br>
      There are three interesting nebulas in Aquila:
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>NGC 6804 shows a small but bright ring</li>
        <li>NGC 6781 which bears some resemblance with the Owl Nebula in Ursa Major</li>
        <li>NGC 6751 also known as the Glowing Eye, a planetary nebula (pictured on the right)</li>
      </ol>
      There is also 4 other clusters in Aquila, 3 open and 1 global.  There is also 3 other nebulas.  Aquila holds the largest single object of galaxies in the Universe known called the Herculesâ€“Corona Borealis Great Wall.  It was discovered in November 2013 and has the size of 10 billion light years.
      <br>
      NASA's Pioneer 11 space probe, which flew by Jupiter and Saturn in the 1972, is expected to pass near the star Aquilae in about 4 million years (if there is 4 million years).
