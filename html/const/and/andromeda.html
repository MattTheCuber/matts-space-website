    <p>
      Andromeda is one of the largest constellations covering an area 722 sq. degrees. Andromeda is located north of the celestial equator, it is named Andromeda, daughter of <a href="../c/cass.html">Cassiopeia</a>. Andromeda is best seen in fall evenings in the Northern Hemispher.
      <br>
      Andromeda is over 1,400 times the<img class="and-2" width="400" height="265" src="./and/andromeda.jpg" alt="Andromeda">size of the full moon, 55% of the size of the largest constellation, <a href="../h/hydra.html">Hydra</a>, and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux.
      <br>
      Andromeda is acutaly made of 12 stars (unlike these maps). Its brightest star, Alpha Andromedae, is a binary star. Sometimes Andromeda is been counted as a part of <a href="../p/pegasus.html">Pegasus</a>. Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color is visible to a human eye. The constellation has an object that is visible to the human eye called: Andromeda Galaxy (M31), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest. The Andromeda galaxy is visible by a human eye. Several fainter galaxies, M110 and M32 and more distant NGC 891, are near Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope, which is in Andromeda.
