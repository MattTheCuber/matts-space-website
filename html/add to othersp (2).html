    		<h2>Kepler Space Telescope</h2>
    		<p>
				NASA's Kepler Mission is mission #10, is was created to search the Milky Way galaxy to find hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near the Milky Way galaxy.

				The method for finding planets is to wait and watch the stars, the planet will cross over the front of the star it will make a dark circle which is the planet, this is called a transit. We can watch these transits on earth with mercury and venus.
				<br>
				The objective of the Kepler Mission is to explore the strure and systems of the other plants. This is done by surveying a large sample of stars to:
				<ol>
					<li>Determine the percentage of terrestrial and larger planets that are in or near the habitable zone of a wide variety of stars</li>
					<li>Determine the distribution of sizes and shapes of the orbits of these planets</li>
					<li>Estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems</li>
					<li>Determine the variety of orbit sizes and planet reflectivities, sizes, masses and densities of short-period giant planets</li>
					<li>Identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques</li>
					<li>Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems.</li>
				</ol>
				Once a planet is found they watch the planet's orbital size which can be calculated from the period of how long it takes to croos over the sun. They can also find the mass of the star using Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The size of the planet is found from the depth of the transit and the size of the star. Finding the orbital size and the temperature of the star, the planet's temperature can be calculated. By studying the edge of the the planet they can determine what gases make the atmosphere. This is some ways of how they study the planet.
				<br>
				Since transits only last a short time, all the stars must be monitored continuously, their brightnesses must be measured at least once every few hours.
